===================
Newton's first law of motion is often stated as

An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.


Objects tend to "keep on doing what they're doing." In fact, it is the natural tendency of objects to resist changes in their state of motion. This tendency to resist changes in their state of motion is described as inertia.

Inertia: the resistance an object has to a change in its state of motion.

Regardless of the angle at which the planes were oriented, the final height was almost always equal to the initial height. If the slope of the opposite incline were reduced, then the ball would roll a further distance in order to reach that original height.
If the opposite incline were elevated at nearly a 0-degree angle, then the ball would roll almost forever in an effort to reach the original height. And if the opposing incline was not even inclined at all (that is, if it were oriented along the horizontal), then ... an object in motion would continue in motion... .

a force is not needed to keep an object in motion

Mass is that quantity that is solely dependent upon the inertia of an object. The more inertia that an object has, the more mass that it has.

Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. But what is meant by the phrase state of motion? The state of motion of an object is defined by its velocity - the speed with a direction. Thus, inertia could be redefined as follows:

Inertia: tendency of an object to resist changes in its velocity.

an object that is not changing its velocity is said to have an acceleration of 0 m/s/s. Thus, we could provide an alternative means of defining inertia:

Inertia: tendency of an object to resist acceleration.


The net force is the vector sum of all the forces that act upon an object. That is to say, the net force is the sum of all the forces, taking into account the fact that a force is a vector and two forces of equal magnitude and opposite direction will cancel each other out


Newton's second law of motion pertains to the behavior of objects for which all existing forces are not balanced. The second law states that the acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object. The acceleration of an object depends directly upon the net force acting upon the object, and inversely upon the mass of the object. As the force acting upon an object is increased, the acceleration of the object is increased. As the mass of an object is increased, the acceleration of the object is decreased.

=====================================================
* no gravity in space
* no friction
=> once force is applied to vessel, vessel keeps constant velocity (either moving or not)

* only force to be applied is vessel's jet
=> accelerates only when jet is activated (up arrow)

* it's a vessel
=> has no break

Vessel must have
State
* speed
* direction
=> velocity

Change of state
* magnitude (value)
* direction (vector)
=> force
